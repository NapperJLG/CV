I get a kick out of problem solving, working with brand new technology as it becomes available and enjoy being involved in a forward thinking industry. Having worked for a number of years as an engineer for a medical diagnostics company, writing scripts for liquid handling robots, I decided to make the move into web development. I enrolled at Makers Academy in order to bring my skills into line with the latest technologies, graduating from the course in June 2019 and getting my first software engineer role at Dacast two months later.

While at Dacast, I have been involved in launching their brand new app from building the component library, constructing the pages and fixing bugs before and after release. Over the course of this project, I have had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge of React and learn some new technologies, such as Redux and Typescript. As my confidence as a developer grew, I took the initiative to get more involved with the backend and learn Go. This allowed me to take the pressure off of our dedicated backend developers by fixing bugs and writing API endpoints to connect to the frontend part of the app. While I have greatly enjoyed my time at Dacast, I am ready for new challenges, new learning opportunities and new projects to which I can add value.

## Other Skills

#### Troubleshooting & Problem solving

- A large part of developing the new app at Dacast has been fixing the inevitable bugs that crop up. When taking a ticket for a bug, it will also often mean working on somebody else's code. Over the course of the project, I have developed the ability to get to grips with code that isn't my own and debug issues using developer tools.

- In my previous role as an engineer at a medical diagnostics company, I was tasked with keeping the in-house liquid dispensing robots running at full capacity. They were almost constantly in use over the course of the working day and problems would often arise seemingly at random. I had to narrow down the cause of the issue, fix it and verify that the robot was suitable for use again in a timely fashion to prevent any loss in production time. I take the same approach with web development and I would be confident in debugging issues with a combination of my own knowledge and online resources.

#### Self Directed Learning

- When I first joined Dacast, I started out working on their legacy platform written in Angular JS. I had no knowledge of Angular before I started. By reading through docs and online tutorials, I was able to understand the framework and complete the tasks assigned to me.

- The backend engineers at Dacast are based in San Francisco. This meant I often found myself blocked if there were backend bugs. I decided to take the time to learn Go, which allowed me to identify and fix these bugs, improving the efficiency of my workflow.

- When I joined AusDiagnostics, the robots that I was tasked with maintaining had never had any maintenance performed on them before. Through reading the manual and experimentation, I wrote a monthly and biannual maintenance protocol for the robots. I then trained all new members of staff to follow these protocols.

- I originally learned to code by teaching myself HTML/CSS via online tutorials. While these tutorials helped me to discover my love of coding, I felt that joining Makers and working with other likeminded individuals would allow me to move my career into web development. Makers Academy was as much about learning how to learn as it was about learning how to code. Over the course of my time at Makers, I became confident in Ruby, Javascript and a variety of frameworks and libraries in both languages. There were several occasions when I went from not knowing a library or framework ([Acebook](https://github.com/NapperJLG/acebook-FiveGuys) - Rails, [Rhythm Is A Maker](https://github.com/NapperJLG/rhythm-is-a-maker) - Tone.js) to building a full stack app in the space of a couple of weeks. Learning and applying new languages and frameworks to my work gives me a great sense of satisfaction.

#### Working in different group sizes

- Over the course of my career, I have worked in different sized teams ranging from 3-4 people at Ausdiagnostics, up to 20+ peole in an NHS laboratory. I am equally comfortable working on my own or as part of a team and have always formed strong working relationships with colleagues in every role.

- Pair programming and group work was a big part of the Makers curriculum. I enjoy working in a pair, whether I am driving or navigating, and thrive when practicing agile methodology.

## Education
