## Jake Napper

I get a kick out of problem solving, seek to work with brand new technology as it becomes available and love the idea of getting involved in a forward thinking industry. As I went from making basic websites in HTML and CSS in my spare time to writing scripts for liquid handling robots at a medical diagnostics company, I knew that coding was something I was passionate about and wanted to pursue as a career. I decided to take a leap of faith and enroll at Makers Academy to give me that first step into the world of professional software development. After an intense and incredibly enjoyable twelve weeks, I feel that I have the necessary skills to hit the ground running as a junior developer.

## Skills

#### Troubleshooting & Problem solving

- In my previous role as an engineer at a medical diagnostics company, I was tasked with keeping the in-house liquid dispensing robots running at full capacity. They were almost constantly in use over the course of the working day and problems would often arise seemingly at random. I had to narrow down the cause of the issue, fix it and verify that the robot was suitable for use again in a timely fashion to prevent any loss in production time.

- Writing code isn't always straight forward and there were plenty of times at Makers when I found myself running into a problem. The coaches would always encourage me to explore all possible lines of research before asking for help. Because of this, I feel confident that I can debug any issues using a combination of my own knowledge and online resources.

#### Self Directed Learning

- When I joined AusDiagnostics, the robots that I was tasked with maintaining had never had any maintainance performed on them before. Through reading the manual and a bit of trial and error, I wrote a monthly and biannual maintanance protocol for the robots. I then trained all new members of staff to follow these protocols.

- I started learning to code by teaching myself HTML/CSS via online tutorials. While these tutorials helped me discover my love of coding, I felt that joining Makers and working with other likeminded individuals would help me turn coding from a hobby into a career.

- Makers Academy was as much about learning how to learn as it was about learning how to code. Over the course of my time at Makers, I became confident in Ruby, Javascript and a variety of frameworks and libraries in both languages. I feel confident that I would be able to learn any programming language.

#### Working in different group sizes

- Over the course of my career, I have worked in different team sizes ranging from 3-4 people at my last role, up to 20+ peole in an NHS laboratory. I am equally comfortable working on my own and part of a team and have always formed strong working relationships with colleauges in every role.

- Pair programming and group work was a big part of the Makers curriculum. I enjoy working in a pair, whether I am driving or navigating, and am comfortable following the agile methodology when working as part of a group.
