I get a kick out of problem solving, seek to work with brand new technology as it becomes available and love the idea of getting involved in a forward thinking industry. I've gone from making basic websites in HTML and CSS in my spare time to writing scripts for liquid handling robots at a medical diagnostics company. This journey led me to realise that that coding was something I was passionate about and wanted to pursue as a career. As an engineer, I knew I wouldn' get the opportunity to code as much as I would like. I decided to take a leap of faith and enroll at Makers Academy to give me that first step into the world of professional software development. After an intense and incredibly enjoyable twelve weeks, my love of coding has only increased and I am extremely excited to get into my first junior developer role.

## Skills

#### Troubleshooting & Problem solving

- In my previous role as an engineer at a medical diagnostics company, I was tasked with keeping the in-house liquid dispensing robots running at full capacity. They were almost constantly in use over the course of the working day and problems would often arise seemingly at random. I had to narrow down the cause of the issue, fix it and verify that the robot was suitable for use again in a timely fashion to prevent any loss in production time. I feel that this skill has translated well to coding and that I could debug any issue with a combination of my own knowledge and online resources.

#### Self Directed Learning

- When I joined AusDiagnostics, the robots that I was tasked with maintaining had never had any maintainance performed on them before. Through reading the manual and a bit of trial and error, I wrote a monthly and biannual maintanance protocol for the robots. I then trained all new members of staff to follow these protocols.

- I started learning to code by teaching myself HTML/CSS via online tutorials. While these tutorials helped me discover my love of coding, I felt that joining Makers and working with other likeminded individuals would help me turn coding from a hobby into a career.
Makers Academy was as much about learning how to learn as it was about learning how to code. Over the course of my time at Makers, I became confident in Ruby, Javascript and a variety of frameworks and libraries in both languages. There were several occasions when I went from not knowing a library or framework ([Acebook](https://github.com/NapperJLG/acebook-FiveGuys) - Rails, [Rhythm Is A Maker](https://github.com/NapperJLG/rhythm-is-a-maker) - Tone.js) to building a full stack app in the space of a couple of weeks.

#### Working in different group sizes

- Over the course of my career, I have worked in different team sizes ranging from 3-4 people at my last role, up to 20+ peole in an NHS laboratory. I am equally comfortable working on my own and part of a team and have always formed strong working relationships with colleauges in every role.

- Pair programming and group work was a big part of the Makers curriculum. I enjoy working in a pair, whether I am driving or navigating, and am comfortable following the agile methodology when working as part of a group.
