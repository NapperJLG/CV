I get a kick out of problem solving, working with brand new technology as it becomes available and enjoy being involved in a forward thinking industry. Having worked for a number of years as an engineer for a medical diagnostics company, writing scripts for liquid handling robots, I decided to make the move into web development. I enrolled at Makers Academy in order to bring my skills into line with the latest technologies, graduating from the course in June 2019 and getting my first software engineer role at Dacast two months later.

While at Dacast, I was involved in building their brand new app from building the component library, building the pages and fixing bugs before release. Over the course of this project, I have had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge of React and learn some new technologies, such as Redux and Typescript. While I have greatly enjoyed my time at Dacast, I am ready for new challenges, new learning opportunities and new projects for me to bring value to.

## Technical Skills

- HTML5/CSS3/Javascript
- Typescript
- React/Redux
- Styled Components

## Other Skills

#### Troubleshooting & Problem solving

- A large part of developing the new app at Dacast has been fixing the inevitable bugs that crop up. When taking a ticket for a bug, it will also often mean working on somebody elses code. Over the course of the project, I have developed the ability to get to grips with whats going on in code that isn't my own and debug issues using developer tools.

- In my previous role as an engineer at a medical diagnostics company, I was tasked with keeping the in-house liquid dispensing robots running at full capacity. They were almost constantly in use over the course of the working day and problems would often arise seemingly at random. I had to narrow down the cause of the issue, fix it and verify that the robot was suitable for use again in a timely fashion to prevent any loss in production time. I take the same approach with web development and I would be confident in debugging issues with a combination of my own knowledge and online resources.

#### Self Directed Learning

- When I first joined Dacast, I started out working on their legacy platform written in Angular JS. I had no knowledge of Angular before I started and didn't know I was going to be working with it until I arrived on my first day. By reading throught docs and working through some online tutorials, I was able to get to grips with the framework enough to complete the tasks assigned to me.

- When I joined AusDiagnostics, the robots that I was tasked with maintaining had never had any maintenance performed on them before. Through reading the manual and a bit of trial and error, I wrote a monthly and biannual maintenance protocol for the robots. I then trained all new members of staff to follow these protocols.

- I originally learned to code by teaching myself HTML/CSS via online tutorials. While these tutorials helped me discover my love of coding, I felt that joining Makers and working with other likeminded individuals would help me make a career move into web development.
Makers Academy was as much about learning how to learn as it was about learning how to code. Over the course of my time at Makers, I became confident in Ruby, Javascript and a variety of frameworks and libraries in both languages. There were several occasions when I went from not knowing a library or framework ([Acebook](https://github.com/NapperJLG/acebook-FiveGuys) - Rails, [Rhythm Is A Maker](https://github.com/NapperJLG/rhythm-is-a-maker) - Tone.js) to building a full stack app in the space of a couple of weeks.

#### Working in different group sizes

- Over the course of my career, I have worked in different sized teams ranging from 3-4 people at my last role, up to 20+ peole in an NHS laboratory. I am equally comfortable working on my own or as part of a team and have always formed strong working relationships with colleagues in every role.

- Pair programming and group work was a big part of the Makers curriculum. I enjoy working in a pair, whether I am driving or navigating, and am comfortable following the agile methodology when working as part of a group.
